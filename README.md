# What is naiveHA
naiveHA is a cheek in tongue for "naive home automation". It is naive as the author is not a professional software developer. Is like naive art: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%C3%AFve_art

# Why re-invent the wheel?
A major effort in the space of home automation is Home Assistant: FOSS and backed by a sizeable community. But Home Assistant also needs fairly expensive hardware (at least a Raspberry Pi 3), is not easy to install (requires an ethernet cable and a keyboard) and not that easy to customize with cheap hardware.

# Introducing naiveHA
naiveHA is meant to make use of cheap hardware (Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, Raspberry Pi Pico W and cheapest breakout modules). It is written in Python 3 and it is easy to extend. This is a typical setup:

# Proof of concept
A few proof of concepts based on the above setup are found in `Proof-Of-Concept/` folder.
Other proof of concepts will follow
